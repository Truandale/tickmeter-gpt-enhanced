## How to Use Multi-Adapter Capture

1. **Enable Multi-Adapter Mode**: Check "–ó–∞—Ö–≤–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å —Å–æ –≤—Å–µ—Ö –∞–¥–∞–ø—Ç–µ—Ä–æ–≤" in Settings
2. **Automatic Detection**: Application will automatically detect and use all physical network adapters
3. **Virtual Adapter Filtering**: Loopback, Hyper-V, VMware, and VirtualBox adapters are automatically excluded
4. **Performance**: Optimized background processing ensures no performance impact
5. **Compatibility**: All existing features (Live Packets View, RTSS, profiles) work normally

## Use Cases

- **Gaming**: Monitor both Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections simultaneously
- **Development**: Capture traffic from multiple network interfaces during testing
- **Network Analysis**: Comprehensive packet monitoring across all active adapters
- **VPN Usage**: Monitor both VPN and direct connections (VPN adapters are filtered out automatically)

## Known Issues
- Line ending warnings during git operations (automatically handled)
